== Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and using Micronaut Jupyter in your project. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working Jupyter environment that can access your Micronaut application's beans, services, and repositories.

=== Quick Start

For those who want to get started immediately:

1. **Add the dependency** to your `build.gradle`:
   [source,groovy]
   ----
   implementation "ai.stainless:micronaut-jupyter:1.1.2"
   ----

2. **Configure kernel location** in `application.yml`:
   [source,yaml]
   ----
   jupyter:
     kernel:
       location: ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
   ----

3. **Start your application**:
   [source,bash]
   ----
   ./gradlew run
   ----

4. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   [source,bash]
   ----
   jupyter lab
   ----

5. **Create a new notebook** with the "Micronaut" kernel and start coding!

=== What You'll Learn

This getting started guide covers:

* **Prerequisites**: What you need installed before starting
* **Project Setup**: Adding Micronaut Jupyter to your project
* **Configuration**: Setting up kernel directories and application configuration
* **Usage Patterns**: Core techniques for working with beans, repositories, and application classes
* **Examples**: Hands-on examples you can run immediately
* **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions

=== Why Use Micronaut Jupyter?

Micronaut Jupyter bridges the gap between your production application code and interactive development. Unlike traditional notebook environments that require you to recreate your application's setup, Micronaut Jupyter gives you direct access to:

* **Your actual application context** - not a simulation
* **Production-ready services and repositories** - with all their configuration and dependencies
* **Real business logic** - test and prototype with the actual code that runs in production
* **Live data connections** - work with actual databases and external services

This makes it perfect for:
* **Data analysis** using your application's business logic
* **Feature prototyping** with access to real services
* **Interactive debugging** of complex application scenarios
* **Live documentation** that stays current with your codebase

=== Step-by-Step Tutorial

Let's walk through creating your first Micronaut Jupyter notebook from scratch.

==== Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the required software installed:

[source,bash]
----
# Check Java version (17+ required)
java -version

# Install Jupyter with tested versions
pip install ipykernel==6.29.5 notebook==6.5.7 tornado==6.4.1 jupyter-client==7.4.9 jupyterlab==3.5.3

# Verify Jupyter installation
jupyter --version
----

==== Step 2: Create or Use an Existing Micronaut Project

If you don't have a Micronaut project, create one:

[source,bash]
----
# Using Micronaut CLI
mn create-app example.micronaut-jupyter-demo --lang=groovy

# Or using curl
curl https://launch.micronaut.io/example.micronaut-jupyter-demo.zip\?lang\=groovy -o demo.zip
unzip demo.zip
cd micronaut-jupyter-demo
----

==== Step 3: Add Micronaut Jupyter Dependency

Edit your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "ai.stainless:micronaut-jupyter:1.1.2"
    // ... your other dependencies
}
----

==== Step 4: Configure Jupyter Kernel Location

Create or edit `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
jupyter:
  kernel:
    location: ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels

micronaut:
  application:
    name: micronaut-jupyter-demo
----

==== Step 5: Create a Simple Service (Optional)

Create a sample service to test with. Create `src/main/groovy/example/GreetingService.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
package example

import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Singleton

@Singleton
class GreetingService {
    String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, ${name}! Welcome to Micronaut Jupyter."
    }
    
    List<String> getAvailableGreetings() {
        return ["Hello", "Hi", "Greetings", "Welcome"]
    }
}
----

==== Step 6: Start Your Application

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew run
----

Wait for the application to start. You should see:
[source]
----
INFO  - Micronaut kernel installed successfully
INFO  - Startup completed in XXXXms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

==== Step 7: Launch Jupyter Lab

In a new terminal (keep your app running):

[source,bash]
----
jupyter lab
----

This opens Jupyter Lab in your browser at http://localhost:8888.

==== Step 8: Create Your First Notebook

1. In Jupyter Lab, click the **"+"** button to create a new launcher
2. Under "Notebook", click **"Micronaut"** (you should see this option)
3. A new notebook opens with the Micronaut kernel

==== Step 9: Test Basic Functionality

In your new notebook, try these cells:

**Cell 1 - Basic Groovy:**
[source,groovy]
----
println "Hello from Micronaut Jupyter!"
def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.collect { it * 2 }
----

**Cell 2 - Access Your Service:**
[source,groovy]
----
// Get the greeting service we created
greetingService = service example.GreetingService

// Use the service
message = greetingService.greet("Developer")
println message
----

**Cell 3 - Explore Service Methods:**
[source,groovy]
----
// Get available greetings
greetings = greetingService.availableGreetings
println "Available greetings: ${greetings}"

// Try different greetings
greetings.each { greeting ->
    println "${greeting}, World!"
}
----

**Cell 4 - Access Application Context:**
[source,groovy]
----
import io.micronaut.context.ApplicationContext
import io.micronaut.context.env.Environment

// Get the application context
context = service ApplicationContext
env = service Environment

// Show application info
println "Application name: ${env.getProperty('micronaut.application.name', String.class)}"
println "Active environments: ${env.activeNames}"
println "Bean count: ${context.allBeanDefinitions.size()}"
----

==== Step 10: Verify Everything Works

If all cells execute successfully, congratulations! You have:

✓ Successfully integrated Micronaut Jupyter into your project
✓ Created and accessed Micronaut beans from notebooks
✓ Demonstrated the core functionality

=== Troubleshooting Your Setup

==== Kernel Not Appearing

**Problem**: "Micronaut" doesn't appear as a kernel option in Jupyter.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your application started without errors
2. Check the application logs for kernel installation messages
3. Verify kernel directory permissions:
   [source,bash]
   ----
   jupyter kernelspec list
   ----
4. Restart Jupyter Lab after starting your application

==== Import Errors

**Problem**: Cannot import application classes with `%import` or regular imports.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your application compiled successfully (`./gradlew compileGroovy`)
2. Check package names are correct
3. Verify classes are in the main source set, not test

==== Service Not Found

**Problem**: `service ClassName` returns errors.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the class is annotated with `@Singleton`, `@Service`, etc.
2. Check the class is in a package scanned by Micronaut
3. Ensure there are no circular dependencies
4. Try using the fully qualified class name

==== Connection Issues

**Problem**: Notebook cells hang or don't execute.

**Solutions**:
1. Restart the kernel (Kernel → Restart Kernel)
2. Check if your application is still running
3. Look for errors in the application logs
4. Try creating a new notebook

==== Permission Errors

**Problem**: Cannot write to kernel directory.

**Solutions**:
1. Use the user directory option: `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels`
2. Fix permissions on the target directory
3. Check the `jupyter.kernel.location` configuration

=== Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check the logs**: Your application logs contain detailed error information
2. **Verify versions**: Ensure you're using compatible versions as listed in the introduction
3. **Try the examples**: The included examples are tested and known to work
4. **Review the setup**: Double-check each configuration step
