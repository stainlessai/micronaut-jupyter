=== Prerequisites

Before setting up Micronaut Jupyter, ensure you have the following installed:

==== Jupyter Environment

Install Jupyter with the tested configuration:

[source,bash]
----
pip install ipykernel==6.29.5 notebook==6.5.7 tornado==6.4.1 jupyter-client==7.4.9 jupyterlab==3.5.3
----

NOTE: While later versions may work, this specific combination has been thoroughly tested.

==== BeakerX Dependencies (Optional but Recommended)

For enhanced visualization and BeakerX features, you'll need to build BeakerX 2.0 manually since it's not yet published:

[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stainlessai/beakerx-jlab2  

cd beakerx-jlab2/beakerx_kernel_base
./gradlew install -xtest        

cd ../beakerx_kernel_groovy
./gradlew install -xtest
----

This builds the required BeakerX 2.0-SNAPSHOT jars to your local Maven cache.

=== Project Setup

==== Add Build Dependencies

Add the necessary repositories to your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    mavenLocal() // Required if using BeakerX 2.0-SNAPSHOT
}
----

Add the Micronaut Jupyter dependency:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation "ai.stainless:micronaut-jupyter:1.1.2"
}
----

==== Configure Kernel Installation Directory

Micronaut Jupyter needs to install kernel specifications that Jupyter can find. Choose one of these approaches:

===== Option 1: Default System Directory (Development Only)

WARNING: This approach has security implications and should only be used in development environments.

Make the default Jupyter kernels directory writable:

[source,bash]
----
sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels
----

===== Option 2: Custom Directory (Recommended)

Create a dedicated directory for kernels:

[source,bash]
----
sudo mkdir -p /opt/jupyter-kernels
sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/jupyter-kernels
----

Configure Jupyter to search this directory by setting the `JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
export JUPYTER_PATH="/opt/jupyter-kernels:$JUPYTER_PATH"
----

Add this to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

Configure your Micronaut application to use this directory in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
jupyter:
  kernel:
    location: /opt/jupyter-kernels/kernels
----

===== Option 3: User Directory

Use Jupyter's user-specific directory (no special permissions required):

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
----

Configure your application:

[source,yaml]
----
jupyter:
  kernel:
    location: ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
----

=== Application Configuration

==== Basic Configuration

Add basic Micronaut Jupyter configuration to your `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
jupyter:
  kernel:
    # Kernel installation directory (see options above)
    location: /opt/jupyter-kernels/kernels
    # Redirect kernel output to application logs
    redirectLogOutput: true
    # Kernel shutdown timeout
    shutdownTimeoutMs: 5000
----

==== Advanced Configuration Options

[source,yaml]
----
jupyter:
  kernel:
    location: /opt/jupyter-kernels/kernels
    redirectLogOutput: true
    shutdownTimeoutMs: 10000
    # Additional JVM options for kernel processes
    jvmOpts: "-Xmx512m -XX:+UseG1GC"
----

=== Docker Support

Each example includes a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment. To run with Docker:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the image
docker build -t my-micronaut-jupyter .

# Run with Jupyter accessible
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8080:8080 my-micronaut-jupyter
----

The container exposes:
- Port 8080: Your Micronaut application
- Port 8888: Jupyter Lab interface
