== Introduction

Micronaut Jupyter is a powerful integration library that connects your Micronaut applications with Jupyter notebooks, enabling interactive development, data analysis, and rapid prototyping directly within your application context.

=== What is Micronaut Jupyter?

Micronaut Jupyter provides a custom Jupyter kernel that runs within your Micronaut application's context, giving you full access to your application's beans, services, repositories, and classpath from within Jupyter notebooks. This creates a powerful development and analysis environment where you can:

* Interactively explore your application's functionality
* Perform data analysis using your application's services and repositories  
* Prototype new features rapidly
* Debug and test application components in real-time
* Create live documentation and tutorials

=== Key Features

==== Enhanced Micronaut Kernel

The Micronaut kernel extends the powerful BeakerX Groovy kernel with native Micronaut integration:

* **Full Groovy Support**: Execute any Groovy code with access to the full Groovy ecosystem
* **Classpath Integration**: Import and use any classes available on your Micronaut application's classpath
* **Bean Access**: Retrieve and interact with any Micronaut bean using the `service` keyword
* **Repository Integration**: Use Micronaut Data repositories and GORM dynamic finders seamlessly
* **Context Awareness**: Access the full Micronaut ApplicationContext and all its features
* **Configuration Access**: Read application configuration and properties
* **Event Handling**: Listen to and publish Micronaut events
* **Isolation & Safety**: Each kernel runs in isolation with proper resource management

==== Advanced Kernel Management

Recent improvements include:

* **Separate Kernel Instances**: Each notebook gets its own isolated kernel instance
* **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of kernel resources and connections
* **ThreadDeath Handling**: Enhanced stability and error recovery mechanisms
* **Reactive Support**: Full support for reactive streams and async operations
* **Hot Reloading**: Support for Micronaut's refresh scope and configuration reloading

==== BeakerX Integration

Built on the robust BeakerX platform, you also get access to:

* **Rich Visualizations**: Charts, plots, and interactive widgets
* **Table Display**: Rich table formatting and manipulation
* **Magic Commands**: Powerful notebook shortcuts and utilities
* **Polyglot Support**: Ability to mix languages within notebooks (when BeakerX is installed)

NOTE: BeakerX features require the `beakerx` Python package to be installed separately.

=== Version Compatibility

Current version (1.1.2) supports:

* **Micronaut**: 4.7.1
* **Groovy**: 4.0.26  
* **Micronaut Data**: 4.12.0
* **BeakerX**: 2.1-SNAPSHOT (requires manual build)
* **JupyterLab**: 3.5.3
* **Jupyter Client**: 7.4.9

=== Use Cases

Micronaut Jupyter is ideal for:

* **Interactive Development**: Rapidly prototype and test new features
* **Data Analysis**: Analyze data using your application's business logic and repositories
* **Live Documentation**: Create executable documentation that always stays current
* **Debugging**: Interactively debug complex application scenarios
* **Training & Demos**: Provide hands-on training environments
* **Research & Experimentation**: Test hypotheses using real application data and logic
