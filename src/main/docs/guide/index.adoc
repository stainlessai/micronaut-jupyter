== What is Micronaut Jupyter?

Micronaut Jupyter bridges the gap between your production Micronaut applications and interactive Jupyter notebooks. Unlike traditional notebook environments, it gives you direct access to your application's:

* **Beans and Services** - Use dependency injection in notebooks
* **Repositories** - Query and manipulate data with your existing data layer
* **Configuration** - Access application properties and environment settings
* **Business Logic** - Test and prototype with actual production code

== Getting Help

* **Documentation Issues**: Check each section's troubleshooting guide
* **Version Compatibility**: See the link:introduction.html#version-compatibility[Version Compatibility] section
* **Examples**: All examples include working code you can run immediately
